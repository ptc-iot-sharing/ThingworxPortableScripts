# ThingWorx Migration scripts for PostgreSQL

This folder should contain subfolders with the relevant migration for all ThingWorx Postgres options.

Please see the official instructions on how to apply them. For example under [Configure and Execute the PostgreSQL Database Script](https://support.ptc.com/help/thingworx/platform/r9.5/en/#page/ThingWorx/Help/Installation/Installation/install_and_configure_postgresql_windows.html#) you can find the instructions for running the scripts on windows.

The scripts require `psql` installed. It is usually installed when you install the PostgreSQL server.
However, you can also install it separately, by following the instructions [here](https://docs.risingwave.com/docs/current/install-psql-without-postgresql/).
